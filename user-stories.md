I'll create user stories for a music rhythm game and then build an HTML/JavaScript prototype using p5.js that randomly generates notes. Let's approach this systematically.

# User Stories for a Music Rhythm Game

From a product management perspective, here are the key user stories:

1. As a player, I want to see notes moving across the screen so I can anticipate when to tap them.
2. As a player, I want to tap notes when they reach a target zone so I can play along with the rhythm.
3. As a player, I want visual feedback when I hit or miss notes so I can improve my timing.
4. As a player, I want to see my score increase when I successfully hit notes so I can track my performance.
5. As a player, I want to hear sounds when I hit notes so I get audio feedback for my actions.
6. As a player, I want the game to track my combo streak so I'm motivated to maintain accuracy.
7. As a player, I want different difficulty levels that change the speed and frequency of notes.

Let me create a prototype that implements these core features using p5.js:

Now I've created a playable rhythm game prototype that addresses all the user stories we identified. Let me explain the key features:

## Core Features Implemented

1. **Lane-based gameplay** - The prototype has 4 lanes with corresponding keys (D, F, J, K)
2. **Random note generation** - Notes appear randomly in different lanes at intervals determined by difficulty
3. **Hit detection system** - The game registers hits when players press keys as notes cross the target zone
4. **Scoring system** - Players earn points based on timing accuracy and combo multipliers
5. **Visual feedback** - The game shows "Perfect!", "Great!", "Good!", or "OK" based on timing
6. **Combo tracking** - A combo counter increases with consecutive hits and resets on misses
7. **Difficulty settings** - Three levels (Easy, Medium, Hard) affecting note speed and frequency
8. **Audio feedback** - Different sounds play for hits and misses using p5.js sound library

## How to Play

1. The game uses the D, F, J, K keys for the four lanes
2. Press the corresponding key when a note reaches the horizontal line
3. Timing matters - perfect hits score more points
4. Chain combos for higher scores
5. Switch difficulty using the buttons at the bottom
6. Press "Restart" to start a new game

## Next Steps for Development

Based on your requirements, here are some future enhancements:

1. **MIDI Integration** - Replace random note generation with events from MIDI files
2. **Improved Visuals** - Add animations, better note designs, and background elements
3. **Multiple Game Modes** - Add different play styles beyond the basic 4-lane setup
4. **Customizable Controls** - Allow players to remap keys
5. **Advanced Scoring** - Implement a rating system (S, A, B, C grades) based on performance
6. **Song Selection** - Create a menu to choose different songs/MIDI files
7. **Mobile Support** - Add touch controls for mobile play

Would you like me to explain any particular part of the implementation in more detail?
